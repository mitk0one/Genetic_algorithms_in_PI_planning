**Abstract** 
<br>   Effective and efficient Program Increment (PI) planning plays a pivotal role in enhancing collaboration and productivity within software development teams following the Agile way of working.

This paper investigates the integration of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) into the PI planning process to address the challenge of optimizing resource allocation. With the usage of examples, it demonstrates the design of binary genetic algorithms and how they could be used for similar optimization problems.
